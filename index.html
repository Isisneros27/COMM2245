INTRODUCTION
	 </h1>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
My name is Isaiah Sisneros I was born and raised here in Albuquerque and this is my first year at UNM. I am a liberal arts major and plan to pursue audio engineering as a career! <br>
<h2>WHY I WANT TO TAKE THIS CLASS</h2> 
<p> I saw this class and was very intrigued for I have a love for and a background in photography as well as graphic design. I primarily shoot on film and thought this class would be a perfect way to learn how to create an online portfolio and have an archive of my digitized work!&nbsp;</p>
<p><h2>EXPIRENCE</h2> I have some very basic knowledge of code from using languages such as Python and Java however this is my first attempt at taking on HTML code using Dreamweaver and I can't wait to get started.
