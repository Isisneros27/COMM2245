My name is Isaiah Sisneros I was born and raised here in Albuquerque and this is my first year at UNM. I am a liberal arts major and plan to pursue audio engineering as a career! I saw this class and was very intrigued for I have a love for and a background in photography as well as graphic design. I primarily shoot on film and thought this class would be a perfect way to learn how to create an online portfolio and have an archive of my digitized work! I have some very basic knowledge of code from using languages such as Python and Java however this is my first attempt at taking on HTML code using Dreamweaver and I can't wait to get started.

The photo below is an example of some of my Photography that I cannot wait to archive and be able to show off in my portfolio!
